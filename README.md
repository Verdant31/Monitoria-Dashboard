<h3>📚 Resume</h3>
This is the project i built for my undergraduate thesis in Computer Science.
<br>
The ideia is basicaly centralize the mentoring process of the University. 
The students have access to an app where they can find all the  students mentor of the university, allowing them to schedule a meet with the mentor and resolve any doubts.
<br>
<br>
This repo is a Dashboard for Coordinators and Professors to visualize which students are trying to become mentors and approve (or not) them. (The app itself is also here in my Github, but not in this repo).
